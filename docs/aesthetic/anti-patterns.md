# Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

## Palette Drift
1. Do not introduce violet/blue/amber/zinc accent systems into Hive components.
2. Do not use dark-mode utility palettes for private CC surfaces.
3. Do not solve differentiation by adding more colors.

## Generic Dashboard Signals
1. Do not rely on status dots as the primary state signal.
2. Do not use dense horizontal card grids for campaign management.
3. Do not use circular progress indicators in place of thin bars.
4. Do not default to emoji-heavy visual labeling.

## Typography Drift
1. Do not use heavy/bold numerals for top metrics.
2. Do not remove mono/uppercase tracking from operational metadata.
3. Do not flatten hierarchy by making all text weights similar.

## Structural Drift
1. Do not mix unrelated panel grammars across tabs.
2. Do not hide critical lane metadata (owner, phase, risk, cost) behind secondary views.
3. Do not design activity as a generic chat list when it should read as an operations ledger.

## Process Drift
1. Do not iterate without a constraints pack (prompt + code + review).
2. Do not accept a change without forbidden-pattern and build audits.
3. Do not log "looks better" without causal explanation and prevention rule.
