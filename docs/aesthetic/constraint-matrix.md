# Constraint Matrix (Prompt vs Code vs Review)

| Constraint | Prompt Layer | Code Layer | Review Layer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Forest/cream identity | Explicitly required in intent | `--hive-*` token palette only | grep for off-brand color utility drift |
| Light metric numerals | Required in non-negotiables | metric classes enforce low font-weight/large size | visual checklist on stats row |
| Vertical campaign hierarchy | Required as structural directive | grouped `HiveCampaignList` + vertical `HiveCampaignCard` | dashboard structure checklist |
| Geometric icon language | Required as iconography directive | glyph usage in data and components | manual check for consistency |
| No status dots | Explicit forbidden pattern | status chips/text lanes instead of dots | grep/manual scan |
| Thin progress bars | Required interaction constraint | progress bars in campaign/task surfaces | component review checklist |
| Monochrome semantics | Required as tone policy | semantic chips via token tints/borders | audit for rainbow badge drift |
| Responsive hierarchy | Required in output contract | grid and stacking classes in CC layout | mobile viewport review |
| Functional preservation | Required in acceptance | keep existing hooks/routes/props contracts | build + behavior smoke checks |

## Minimum Viable Spec
1. Intent paragraph with domain metaphor.
2. Two-way reference mapping (`copy` / `avoid`).
3. Non-negotiables list.
4. Forbidden-pattern list.
5. Output contract with self-audit requirements.
